# MLB Exploration

This is some basic MLB Exploration. This is ever ongoing. This is where I will keep all my files while I branch out and learn more.

To view any HTML rendered `.rmd` files, go to [https://htmlpreview.github.io/](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) to view, and add the link to the file as a query.

For example, for the main.html file in this repository: visit [https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mcclainclain/mlb-exploration/blob/main/main.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mcclainclain/mlb-exploration/blob/main/main.html)
